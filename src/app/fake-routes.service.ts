 * 
 * Let's say that at build time, there's a single route path defined by the remote Routes API.
 * Then for some reason, a new route is added and activated by the API, and is now added to the Router Config.
 * 
 * We are in a case where the Server routes manifest only contains the first route, but the SSR and the Browser Router Configs have both routes.
 * In this case if I load the /video route, it will end up with a 404 error.
